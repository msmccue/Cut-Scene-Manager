## Steel Spirit

I have copied these files into this project because the Cut-Scene-Python project references several classes and functions, but the project isn't yet fleshed out enough and didn't include them.  Working under the assumption [@murchie85](https://github.com/murchie85) was breaking out the Cut-Scene-Python project from past projects, I was lucky to find that he has already provided this code in a directory called "utils".

These files are untouched from the steelSpirit repo; useful code will be copied into the main directory either on its own or placed in utils.py.
