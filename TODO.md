- clean up code; try to keep original spacing and alignment
- find the uses of the gui object in runCutScene
  - gui.screen
  - ...
- find the uses of the game object in runCutScene

- create a new wrapper that provides default gui and game settings
  - make it simple for our standard pygame structure (see /samples directory for my course examples)
